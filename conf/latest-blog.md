Just like that, we now have a 3D RPG Prototype live online. It's not an incredible piece of art or anything out of the norm, but it's a working prototype, so I'm pretty happy about that.

You can find a link to the prototype on the Projects page. Have a look, mess around with the prototype and feel free to leave some feedback on what you want to see next.

I'll look to include some more information about the development process in the coming weeks and months, so stay tuned for more information and more updates to that project.

In the interim, I'll also be looking to make some updates to this site, possibly looking at addressing this blog system and maybe adding Hugo in to manage this content.

Until then, take care and happy tinkering.
