# Welcome to the first post on my blog!

Welcome to the first blog post on my website.
  
#### A bit of background  
  
This website is written in Scala, using the Play Framework. I decided to make this blog for myself as I
wanted something to work on in my spare time that wasn't just a large game project. The initial website was written in
just 2 days, over a weekend. It went from not existing on the Saturday morning to live and deployed by the Monday morning.  
  
Over time, I'll be updating this blog to make sure I keep an archive of previous posts.  
  
For the curious amongst you, this blog post was written using Markdown. I'm using a Scala dependency called [Laika](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/downloads/laika-0.18-sbt.pdf).  
  
Worth a read for the curious.
  
### Thanks for reading

Over the coming months, expect a couple of more projects from me on this very website.
