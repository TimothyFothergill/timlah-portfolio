I've been working on a project in Unity recently. After attempting some work in [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io), I found I wasn't making the progress I wanted to. Nevertheless, I'll return to investigating that library at some point.

For now though, I've returned to Unity, where I am hoping to have a prototype for a 3D RPG up on this website within the next week.

Fingers crossed!
