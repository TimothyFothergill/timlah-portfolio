Welcome to the first blog post on [Timlah's Techs](https://www.timlah.com).
  
#### A bit of background

This website is written in Scala, using the Play Framework. I decided to make a website for myself as I
wanted something to work on in my spare time that wasn't just a large game project. The initial website was written in
just 2 days, over a weekend. It went from not existing on the Saturday morning to live and deployed by the Monday morning.  
  
Over time, I'll be updating this blog to make sure I keep an archive of previous posts. To do this, I'll need to create
a MongoDB instance, which will store the content of my articles.
  
For the curious amongst you, this blog post was written using Markdown. I'm using a Scala dependency called [Laika](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/downloads/laika-0.18-sbt.pdf). 
Currently to get this blog up and running, I have a file in my `conf/` folder, called `latest-blog.md`. This method isn't as 
feature rich as say a full editor, such as Wordpress, but it's something I developed myself, and it does, for now, a decent
job.
  
### Thanks for reading

Over the coming months, expect a couple of more projects from me on this very website.
